# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict student performance based on various demographic and academic factors using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the relationship between features like gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, and test scores, we can forecast student outcomes and potentially identify areas where interventions could improve academic performance.

### Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

- **gender**: Gender of the student
- **race_ethnicity**: The student's racial or ethnic group
- **parental_level_of_education**: Highest level of education completed by the student's parents
- **lunch**: Type of lunch the student receives (standard or reduced/free)
- **test_preparation_course**: Whether the student completed a test preparation course
- **math_score**: Score in the math test
- **reading_score**: Score in the reading test
- **writing_score**: Score in the writing test
- **total_score**: Sum of all test scores
- **average**: Average score across all subjects

### Project Life Cycle

#### 1. Understanding the Problem Statement
- The goal is to predict student performance based on demographic and educational data.
- Determine the target variable (e.g., total score or average) and define the success criteria for model performance.

#### 2. Data Collection
- The dataset can be sourced from educational institutions or publicly available datasets.
- Ensure that the data includes the features listed above for accurate analysis and prediction.

#### 3. Data Checks to Perform
- **Check for missing values**: Handle any missing data in the dataset.
- **Data types**: Ensure correct data types for categorical and numerical features.
- **Outliers**: Identify and treat any outliers that could skew model performance.

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the distribution of numerical features such as math, reading, and writing scores.
- Explore the relationships between demographic factors and student performance.
- Visualize the data through histograms, bar charts, and correlation matrices to gain insights.

#### 5. Data Pre-Processing
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical features like gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education level into numerical formats using encoding techniques.
- **Feature Scaling**: Apply feature scaling for numerical values to ensure the modelâ€™s efficiency.
- **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and test sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

#### 6. Model Training
- Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models for accuracy.

#### 7. Choosing the Best Model
- Evaluate each model based on performance metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and R-squared.
- Choose the model that provides the best prediction on the test data.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - jupyter (optional, for running notebooks)

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mukesh1996-ds/student-performance-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for model training and evaluation.

### Results

- After model training and evaluation, the best model will be selected based on the performance on the test dataset.
- The model will output predictions of student performance based on input features.

### Future Work

- Include additional features, such as extracurricular activities or socio-economic status, to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore deep learning models to enhance prediction capabilities.
