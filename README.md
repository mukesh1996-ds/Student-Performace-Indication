# Project Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the Python environment for this project using `venv`, installing the required dependencies, and creating necessary configuration files.

## 1. Creating a Virtual Environment
First, create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **Linux/Mac**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

## 2. Installing Requirements
After setting up the virtual environment, install the required packages.

Make sure you have a `setup.py` file where the dependencies are specified. To install the requirements, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. setup.py Configuration

Ensure your `setup.py` looks something like this:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='project_name',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        # List your dependencies here, for example:
        'numpy',
        'pandas',
        'requests'
    ],
)
```

This file will ensure that all dependencies are properly installed when you run `pip install -e .`.

## 4. Requirements Installation
If you prefer, you can also specify dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file:

```
numpy
pandas
requests
```

Then install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. How to Run
Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run your project by activating the virtual environment and executing the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Thatâ€™s it! Your environment is now ready to go.
